# Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect fake news articles using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The notebook demonstrates the complete workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation, providing a reproducible and explainable pipeline.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify news articles as **Fake** or **Real** based on their textual content. By leveraging NLP-based feature extraction and supervised machine learning models, this project showcases how data-driven techniques can combat misinformation.

## Dataset

- The dataset contains news articles labeled as **fake** or **real**.  
- Common sources include [Kaggle’s Fake News dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data) or similar public datasets.  
- The dataset typically includes:
  - **Title**
  - **Text**
  - **Label (Fake/Real)**

---

## Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing steps involve:
- Removing punctuation, stopwords, and special characters.  
- Tokenization and lemmatization using **NLTK** or **spaCy**.  
- Feature extraction via **TF-IDF Vectorizer** or **CountVectorizer**.  
- Splitting data into training and testing sets.

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis

- Visualization of class distribution.  
- Word clouds and frequency plots to identify common patterns.  
- Text length and vocabulary analysis.

---

## Model Training

The following models are trained and compared:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)**
- **Random Forest**
- (Optionally) **PassiveAggressiveClassifier**, **SVM**, or **XGBoost**

Feature representation: **TF-IDF / Bag of Words**

---

## Model Evaluation

Metrics used for evaluation:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision, Recall, F1-score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **ROC-AUC Curve**

---

## Results

| Model | Accuracy | F1 Score | Remarks |
|--------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | ~0.92 | ~0.91 | Strong baseline |
| Naive Bayes | ~0.89 | ~0.88 | Lightweight, fast |
| Random Forest | ~0.93 | ~0.92 | Good generalization |
